**smartLists**  | `false` | Use smarter list behavior than the original markdown. May eventually be default with the old behavior moved into pedantic.
**smartypants** | `false` | Use "smart" typographic punctuation for things like quotes and dashes.


## Remark

Option          | Default | Description
:---            | :---    | :---
**breaks**      | `false` | Enable GFM [line breaks][gfm]. This option requires the gfm option to be true.

# Content Options

Option          | Default | Description
:---            | :---    | :---
**autoreload**  | `false` | Auto reload on file change
**toc**         | `false` | Generate Table of Contents
**mathjax**     | `false` | Render TeX and LaTeX math blocks
**mermaid**     | `false` | Render Mermaid diagrams
**emoji**       | `false` | Convert emoji :shortnames: into EmojiOne images
**scroll**      | `true`  | Remember scroll position


## Autoreload

When enabled the extension will make a GET request every second to:

- `file://` URLs
- any host that resolves to localhost IPv4 `127.0.0.1` or IPv6 `::1`


## TOC

- Generates Table of Contents (TOC) based on the headers found in the markdown document.


## MathJax

The following `mathjax` delimiters are supported:

- inline math: `\(math\)`, `$math$`, and ``$`math`$``
- display math: `\[math\]`, `$$math$$`, and math code blocks (```` ```math ````)

The following rules apply to your content when `mathjax` is enabled:

- Regular dollar sign `$` in text that is not part of a math formula should be escaped: `\$`
- Regular markdown escaping for parentheses: `\(` and `\)`, and brackets: `\[` and `\]` is not supported. MathJax will convert anything between these delimiters to math formulas, unless they are wrapped in backticks: `` `\(` `` or fenced code blocks.

> The MathJax support currently works only on local file URLs and remote origins without strict *Content Security Policy (CSP)* set. For example it won't work for files hosted on the GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin. However you can bypass this by enabling the [Disable CSP](#disable-content-security-policy) switch for that origin.


## Mermaid

Render Mermaid diagrams wrapped in `mmd` or `mermaid` fenced code blocks:

    ```mmd
    sequenceDiagram
    ```

## Emoji

- Emoji shortnames like: `:sparkles:` will be converted to :sparkles: using [EmojiOne][emojione] images.
- Currently unicode symbols like `âœ¨` and ASCII emoji like `:D` are not supported.

> The Emoji support currently works only on local file URLs and remote origins without strict *Content Security Policy (CSP)* set. For example it won't work for files hosted on the GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin. However you can bypass this by enabling the [Disable CSP](#disable-content-security-policy) switch for that origin.


## Scroll

- When enabled, the `scroll` option remembers the current scroll position and scrolls back to it after page load.
- When disabled, the `scroll` option either scrolls to the top of the document or to a certain header (anchor) if a hash URL fragment is present.


# Advanced Options

Detecting and rendering [local file URLs](#local-files) can be enabled by using the `Allow access to file URLs` option for the extension.

Access to remote URLs however, needs to be enabled manually.


## Add Origin

Here is how you can enable the extension for the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` origin:

![add-origin]

The origin consists of *protocol* part and *domain* part. The *protocol* can be either `https`, `http`, or a `*` to match both `https` and `http`.


## Allow All Origins

In case you really want to you can enable the extension for **all** origins:

![all-origins]

Alternatively you can use the `Allow All` button.

> **Note:** Take a look at the [Path Matching Priority](#path-matching-priority) section below to see how the Markdown content is being included for or excluded from rendering!


## Header Detection

When this option is enabled the extension will check for the presence of the `text/markdown` and `text/x-markdown` *content-type* header before trying to match the path:

![header-detection]


## Path Matching

If the header detection is disabled or a proper *content-type* header is missing, the extension will check if the URL is ending with a markdown file extension.

The default regular expression is: `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`

It's a simple regular expression that matches URLs ending with:

- markdown file extension: `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)`
- and optionally anchor or querystring after that: `(?:#.*|\?.*)?`

> The `?:` used in `(?:match)` stands for *non-capturing group* and it's there for performance reasons.

You can modify the path matching regular expression for each enabled origin individually. The settings are being updated as you type.


## Path Matching Priority

The enabled origins are matched from most specific to least specific:

1. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` or `http://raw.githubusercontent.com`
2. `*://raw.githubusercontent.com`
3. `*://*`

Only the first matching origin is picked and then its Path Matching RegExp is used to match the entire URL. If it fails no other attempts are made to match the URL.

### Custom Path

- __`*://website.com`__ - `\/some\/custom\/path\/to\/serve\/markdown\/$`
- __`*://*`__ - `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`

In this example we have allowed all origins (the last entry). It uses the default Path Matching RegExp that is going to match only URLs ending with markdown file extension.

In case we want to match a custom path we have to add a more specific origin and specify its Path Matching RegExp accordingly.

### Exclude Origin

- __`*://github.com`__ - `something impossible to match !!!`
- __`*://*`__ - `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`

In this example we have allowed all origins (the last entry). It uses the default Path Matching RegExp that is going to match only URLs ending with markdown file extension.

The problem is that some origins may serve rendered HTML content on URLs ending with markdown file extension.

GitHub:
- https://github.com/simov/markdown-syntax/blob/master/README.md - *HTML*
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simov/markdown-syntax/master/README.md - *Markdown*

In this case we want to exclude the `github.com` origin altogether and for that we have to add more specific origin and set its Path Matching RegExp to something that's impossible to match.

### Exclude Path

- __`*://bitbucket.org`__ - `.*\/raw\/.*\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`
- __`*://gitlab.com`__ - `.*\/raw\/.*\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`
- __`*://*`__ - `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`

In this example we have allowed all origins (the last entry). It uses the default Path Matching RegExp that is going to match only URLs ending with markdown file extension.

The problem is that some origins may serve rendered HTML content on URLs ending with markdown file extension.

BitBucket:
- https://bitbucket.org/simovelichkov/markdown-syntax/src/master/README.md - *HTML*
- https://bitbucket.org/simovelichkov/markdown-syntax/raw/master/README.md - *Markdown*

GitLab:
- https://gitlab.com/simovelichkov/markdown-syntax/blob/master/README.md - *HTML*
- https://gitlab.com/simovelichkov/markdown-syntax/raw/master/README.md - *Markdown*

In this case we want to match only URLs containing the `raw` word in their path and for that we have to add more specific origins and set their Path Matching RegExp accordingly.


## Remove Origin

At any point click on the `REMOVE` button for the origin that you want to remove. This actually removes the permission itself so that the extension is no longer able to inject code into that origin.

Note that the Chrome's consent popup shows up only when you add the origin for the first time. In case you re-add it you'll no longer see that popup. That's a Chrome thing and it's not controllable through the extension.


## Refresh Origin

The extension synchronizes your preferences across all of your devices using Google Sync. The list of your allowed origins is being synced too. However, the actual permissions that you grant using the Chrome's consent popup cannot be synced.

In case you've recently added a new origin on one of your devices you'll have to explicitly allow it on your other devices. In this case additional **`refresh`** label will be shown for each origin that needs to be _refreshed_. This label is present **only** on those devices that needs to be _refreshed_. Expanding the origin will reveal additional `REFRESH` button:

![refresh-origin]


## Disable Content Security Policy

Some remote origins may serve its content with a `content-security-policy` header set that prevents the extension from executing certain JavaScript code inside the content of that page. For example on `raw.githubusercontent.com` certain things such as remembering your scroll position, generating TOC, displaying MathJax or Emojis won't work.

Using the `Disable Content Security Policy` switch you can optionally tell the extension to strip that header from the incoming request and therefore allow its full functionality to work:

![disable-csp]

Note that the Content Security Policy header will be stripped **only** if the URL matches the corresponding [Path Matching RegExp](#path-matching) for that origin.

Even if you have [Allowed All Origins](#allow-all-origins) and disabled the Content Security Policy at the same time, the header will be stripped **only** for those requests with URL that matches your explicitly set [Path Matching RegExp](#path-matching) for the Allow All origin `*://*`


## Character Encoding

By default Markdown Viewer uses the browser's built-in encoding detection. In case you want to force certain Character Encoding for an origin - use the Encoding select control.

The Character Encoding set for origin is used only when the markdown content is served with explicit `Content-Type` header and explicit `charset`. In all other cases Chrome picks the correct encoding by default.

In Firefox the character encoding is set always when enabled.


# Markdown Syntax and Features

A separate repository containing examples about: markdown syntax, syntax highlighting in code blocks, mathjax etc. is hosted on all major Git hosting providers: [GitHub][syntax-github], [GitLab][syntax-gitlab], [BitBucket][syntax-bitbucket].

Allow the appropriate origin to render the raw markdown files directly on: [GitHub][syntax-raw-github], [GitLab][syntax-raw-gitlab], [BitBucket][syntax-raw-bitbucket], or pull any of these repositories locally and play around with the extension's options.
